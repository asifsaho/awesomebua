# History Behind
A problem inspire us to build this kind of thing, we are 12 person live in a single place and faced problem when the cook come, nobody known how many meal to order also we needed to keep a track. Asif came up with a idea to make a online app and book meal there, when the cook come anyone can tell the amount of people going to take meal. So this is the basic idea, we are intrigating more features in it like utility bills, house rent, and other cost calculation, monthly report etc.
